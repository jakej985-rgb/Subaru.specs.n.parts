## 2024-05-22 - 2024 Crosstrek Coverage
**Learning:** 2024 Crosstrek was missing 4/5 trims. Engine codes differ by trim (Base/Premium = FB20, Sport/Limited/Wilderness = FB25).
**Action:** Added Base, Premium, Limited, Wilderness. Used FB20/FB25 engine codes based on trim.

## 2024-05-27 - 2024 WRX Coverage
**Learning:** 2024 WRX coverage was incomplete, missing Premium, TR, and GT trims. 2024 introduces the "TR" trim (Performance-focused) and "GT" is the top trim with SPT (CVT).
**Action:** Added Premium, TR, and GT trims to `assets/seed/vehicles.json` for 2024 WRX. All share the FA24 engine code.
