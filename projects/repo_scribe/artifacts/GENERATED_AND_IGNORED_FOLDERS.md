# Generated & Ignored Folders 🙈

This document explains the purpose of generated and ignored folders in the workspace. These are **NOT** unused files; they are essential artifacts of the build process or developer tooling.

## Artifacts

### `build/`
*   **Status**: Ignored
*   **Generator**: Flutter / Dart build system.
*   **Purpose**: Contains compiled code, intermediate build files, and the final APK/IPA.
*   **Action**: Safe to delete (`flutter clean`), but will be regenerated on next build.

### `.dart_tool/`
*   **Status**: Ignored
*   **Generator**: Dart / Pub.
*   **Purpose**: Stores package configuration, build cache, and other tooling metadata.
*   **Action**: Safe to delete, will be regenerated by `flutter pub get`.

### `.idea/`
*   **Status**: Ignored (usually)
*   **Generator**: IntelliJ IDEA / Android Studio.
*   **Purpose**: Project-specific IDE settings.

### `.vscode/`
*   **Status**: Mixed (often tracked)
*   **Generator**: Visual Studio Code.
*   **Purpose**: Workspace settings, launch configurations, and recommended extensions.

### `android/.gradle/`
*   **Status**: Ignored
*   **Generator**: Gradle (Android build tool).
*   **Purpose**: Caches for Android build dependencies.

### `pubspec.lock`
*   **Status**: Tracked
*   **Generator**: `flutter pub get`
*   **Purpose**: Locks dependency versions to ensure consistent builds across environments. **DO NOT DELETE.**
