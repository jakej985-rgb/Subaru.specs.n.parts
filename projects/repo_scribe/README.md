# RepoScribe 🗺️📚

Welcome to the **RepoScribe** project documentation.

## Mission
RepoScribe produces clear, newbie-friendly documentation that helps:
1.  **New contributors** understand the app structure, entry points, and key flows.
2.  **Maintainers** identify dead, unused, or legacy files safely.

## Artifacts
All generated documentation is located in the `artifacts/` directory:

*   [**ONBOARDING_CHEATSHEET.md**](artifacts/ONBOARDING_CHEATSHEET.md): A "start here" guide for new developers.
*   [**FILE_INDEX.md**](artifacts/FILE_INDEX.md): A comprehensive map of the codebase files and their purposes.
*   [**ENTRYPOINTS_AND_CALLS.md**](artifacts/ENTRYPOINTS_AND_CALLS.md): A breakdown of main functions, scripts, and CI workflows.
*   [**UNUSED_FILE_CANDIDATES.md**](artifacts/UNUSED_FILE_CANDIDATES.md): A list of files that appear to be unused and are candidates for removal or archiving.

## Usage
These documents are static snapshots generated by the RepoScribe agent. They should be updated periodically as the codebase evolves.
