# RepoJanitor Legacy Audit Report [AGENT CLUTTER]

**Date:** 2026-01-12
**Generated by:** RepoJanitor 🧹
**Status:** AGENT FOLDER DUPLICATION

Investigating potential duplicate agent definitions.

---

### � Duplicate "Brain" Folders (High Confidence)
You have two folders defining agents. The user rules (`AGENTS.md`) point to `Agents - Jules`.
The `.jules/` folder appears to be an older, less complete version.

| Confidence | Path | Notes | Recommendation |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **8** | `.jules/` | Contains 11 generic agent prompts. `Agents - Jules/` has 27 rich ones. | `MOVE_TO_LEGACY` |

### ℹ️ Typos / Names
*   `Agents - Jules/SpecHavester.md` -> Typos "Harvester" as "Havester"? (Filename check only).
*   `Agents - Jules/RepoJantor.md` -> Typos "Janitor" as "Jantor"?

### Action Plan
1.  **Move** the entire `.jules/` folder to `legacy/jules_backup/`.
2.  **Rename** the typo files in `Agents - Jules/`? (Optional, might break your prompt references if you don't update them, so I will just flag them).

**Proposed Command:**
Move `.jules/` to `legacy/`.
